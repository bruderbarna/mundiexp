#basic idea
This is a fairly simple google app engine application.
There is a folder for markdown files, and a folder for image files.
The user sees a webpage with a short introduction and explanation of the site's purpose.
Then below that the user will see clickable images.
Upon clicking on the image, the user will see a lightroom, a popup with the image and the markdown by its side.
